This repo contains a few scripts and libs to make Creative X-FI 5.1 USB sound card work properly on ubuntu (including remote control RM-820).

To install it simply run the "install.sh" script FROM TERMINAL(!!!). A few configuration files will be either modified or overwritten, some of them will be created. The script will create the following path:
	~/skriptai/creative/remote
where scripts will be stored.
The following packages will be installed:
	lirc
	lirc-x
	xdotool
	irexec
	xmacro

WARNING!
Backup your existing ~/.lircrc, /etc/lirc/lircd.conf and /etc/lirc/hardware.conf files since they will be either overwritten or modified!!!
Everytime the soundcard is connected, pulseaudio server will be restarted so video/audio playbacks may need a restart as well.
